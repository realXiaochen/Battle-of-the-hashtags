# The battle of the hashtags

This application allows an administrator to create ‘contests’ between two hashtags, comparing the number of typos in tweets tagged with them.
A programmatic and automated approach is used to fetch tweets from the hashtags in question, on a periodic basis.
After a predetermined amount of time, the winning hashtag will be the one with the smallest total number of typos.
